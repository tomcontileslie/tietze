# Week 8, Computational Mathematics Wednesday Meeting

Tom, Ben, Reinis, James

- Discussed links between suffix automaton (Reinis) and our project.
- Decided most of the 8000 lines of GAP/C code for group Tietze was not usable and too complicated so we should aim for something simpler
- First goal is already to actually implement functions that can apply Tietze transformations to semigroup presentations
- Then we can look into creating a `SimplifyPresentation` implementation where we apply Tietze transformations semi-intelligently. Once we have Tietze 1-4
  implemented, the obvious moves for simplifying are:
  1. If one of the relations expresses one generator `a` in terms of all the others, e.g. `bcbb`, then apply e.g. `TietzeTransformation4(tietze_object, a)`
    to eliminate the generator
  2. If Reinis' suffix automaton identifies a subword e.g. `bcbd` that occurs frequently in the presentation and is fairly long, then choose a new generator
    `e` and apply e.g. `TietzeTransformation3(tietze_object, e, bcbd)` followed by `TietzeTransformation4(tietze_object, e, bcbd)`
  3. If one relation follows from all the others, e.g. `be=ccb`, then apply `TietzeTransformation2(tietze_object, be, ccb)`.
- Discussed what would happen if we basically just got the function to check whether any of the above moves were possible at each step, then apply
  the one that reduces total length the most, then repeat until no more steps are possible. This will certainly terminate and converge to a local maximum,
  although we cannot guarantee that it will be optimal overall. In fact, finding the shortest expression for a presentation is likely undecidable (can
  wrangle the problem into a form which could solve the halting problem).
- We will need suffix automaton functions, as well as things like Knuth-Bendix from libsemigroups, to perform some of the above substitutions.
  We should avoid functions like `ReducedConfluentRewritingSystem` which sometimes doesn't terminate. Instead we should do string rewriting using libsemigroups
  and set a time limit to give up (can't do this in GAP just yet, but James can write functions which will run that in C for us so we can enter
  placeholders for them for now).
- For Knuth-Bendix, we don't need a reduced confluent rewriting system to check whether a relation is redundant. An easier method for a relation `[r1, r2]`
  is to apply all the other relations to subwords of `r1` and `r2`, taking care to apply only ones which will give something shortlex smaller. Then this
  sequence converges, and if we end up with `[r, r]`, then we know the relation is redundant. Of course there can be cases where the relation is redundant
  but this method does not show that.
- Discussed best representation for words. Rather than ExtRep `[generator, power, ...]` format, it's probably easier to work with flat lists
  `[generator, generator, generator, ...]`, so we will do that for now.
- We will probably want to create some kind of fp semigroup "Tietze Object". Then we could manually apply Tietze transformations to the object before converting
  back to a fp semigroup, e.g.:
  ```
  gap> f := FreeSemigroup(["a", "b"]);;
  gap> AssignGeneratorVariables(f);;
  gap> s := f / [[a*b, b*a], [a^2, a]];;
  gap> stz := FpSemigroupToTietzeObject(s);
  <semigroup Tietze object>
  gap> TietzeTransformation2(stz, etc...);
  gap> TietzeTransformation3(stz, etc...);
  gap> new_s := TietzeObjectToFpSemigroup(stz);
  <fp semigroup on the generators [...]>
  ```
  at which point we would have an isomorphic, but differently presented, fp semigroup `new_s`.
  We would also be able to automatically reduce the presentation rather than manually apply transformations using some analogue of `TzGo`, e.g.
  ```
  gap> stz := FpSemigroupToTietzeObject(s);
  <semigroup Tietze object>
  gap> StzGo(stz);
  #I  eliminating generator a
  #I  adding generator e = bcbd
  #I  elimination relation be = ccb
  gap> new_s := TietzeObjectToFpSemigroup(stz);
  <fp semigroup on the generators [...]>
  ```
- First draft of representation is that the stz object should be represented as a record
  `stz := rec(gens := [a, b], rels := [[[1, 2], [2, 1]], [[1, 1], [1]]])` where `gens`
  are the generators of the fp semigroup (rather than the free semigroup that was
  quotiented).
- Made some conversion functions fp semigroup <-> stz object.
