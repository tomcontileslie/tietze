# Spring Break Week 2, Wednesday

Tom

- Mostly just made progress on the Tietze functions. End result is that the file `gap/transformations.g` contains all functions
  `TietzeTransformation1` through to `TietzeTransformation4`.
- So far the suggestion for the internal representation of the Tietze object has been a record containing at least a "generators"
  component and a "relations" component, so that is the assumed input for these four functions. Realised that as suggested by Ben,
  the best representation for the generators is probably strings rather than actual GAP objects. Indeed, if you create a Tietze
  where `stz.gens` is a list of the generators of the fp semigroup that `stz` was generated from, those generators will have
  nothing to do with the ones you get once you've applied a Tietze transformation (since the resulting semigroup will have different
  relations, so will be a different semigroup). So just the strings is just enough for the output to seem sensible and legible to
  the user, without requiring too much acrobatics.
- Full worked example of what you can do with the new functions is below. Note that `FpSemigroupToStzObj` and `StzObjToFpSemigroup` are
  functions from `helpers.g` that will be replaced with Ben's implementation in `stzobj.g` in due course. Also, we have yet to
  develop `NC` versions of these functions for internal use, and in general argument checking needs some revision.
```
gap> f := FreeSemigroup(["a", "b"]);;
gap> AssignGeneratorVariables(f);
#I  Assigned the global variables [ a, b ]
gap> s := f / ParseRelations([a, b], "aa=a, bb=b, abab=ab, baba=ba");
<fp semigroup on the generators [ a, b ]>
gap> stz := FpSemigroupToStzObj(s);;
gap> stz;
rec( gens := [ "a", "b" ], rels := [ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ],
      [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ] ] )
gap> TietzeTransformation1(stz, [[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1]]);
gap> stz;
rec( gens := [ "a", "b" ], rels := [ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ],
      [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 1, 2, 1 ] ] ] )
gap> TietzeTransformation2(stz, 5);
gap> stz;
rec( gens := [ "a", "b" ], rels := [ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ],
      [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ] ] )
gap> TietzeTransformation3(stz, [1, 2]);
gap> stz;
rec( gens := [ "a", "b", "c" ], rels := [ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ],
      [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ], [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3 ] ] ] )
gap> TietzeTransformation4(stz, 3);
gap> stz;
rec( gens := [ "a", "b" ], rels := [ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ],
      [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ] ] )
gap> StzObjToFpSemigroup(stz);
<fp semigroup on the generators [ a, b ]>
```
- Breakdown of the effect of each Tietze function in the example above:
  1. `TietzeTransformation1(stz, [[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1]])` adds a redundant relation to `stz`, in this case the relation `abaaba=aba`. See
     how that relation has been added when viewing `stz` just after. 
  2. `TietzeTransformation2(stz, 5)` removes the redundant 5th relation in the list of relations of `stz`. In this case we've
     just removed the relation we added before, so observing `stz` straight afterwards looks like it was at the beginning.
  3. `TietzeTransformation3(stz, [1, 2])` adds a new generator equal to the word `[1, 2]`, i.e. `ab` when translating into the generators in this case.
     It automatically chooses a name for the new generator that goes along with what has been used so far (notice here it chose "c").
  4. `TietzeTransformation4(stz, 3)` removes the third generator (i.e. c), provided it can find a relation which allows it to express "c" in terms of
     the other generators (here the relation that does that is the one we added at the previous step, i.e. `c=ab`).
- Once we've applied Tietze transformations to taste, we can "export" the result as an actual fp semigroup by running `StzObjToFpSemigroup` at the end,
  as is done at the end of the example.
- We may eventually want more evocative names than just `TietzeTransformationX`, but these are the semantically easy choices given that Tietze transformations
  are always listed in exactly the order used here.
