# Week 10, Computational Mathematics Wednesday Meeting

Tom, Ben

- Ben has completed the GAP object work (changing from AttributeStoringRep to ComponentObjectRep). He also implemented a number of essential
  functions for IsStzPresentation objects (\<, Length, ViewString, and lots of setters).
- We then pair-programmed the transition of the
  essential source code from this repository to a fresh branch of [Semigroups](https://github.com/semigroups/Semigroups). The work now lives in
  [this PR](https://github.com/semigroups/Semigroups/pull/762).
- Dealt with variable issues and linting problems.
- Added *forward map* and *backward map* functionality (applying tietze transformations to an IsStzPresentation object automatically updates components
  expressing the generators of the original semigroup in terms of the new generators, and vice versa).
- Created `TietzeIsomorphism` method
- Discussed how to implement SimplifyPresentation: at each step, find the move that results in the greatest length reduction. Do this by creating
  a list of functions, each of which is able to scout out the maximum length reduction that could be achieved using a certain method. Potential methods
  include:
  - Removing a redundant relation
  - Removing a generator if it is expressed as a word on the other generators
  - Adding a new generator that equals a commonly occurring subword, e.g.:
    ```
    abbabb=abb, b=cc
      becomes (by Tietze3, add generator)
    abbabb=abb, b=cc, d=abb
      becomes (by Tietze1, add redundant relation)
    abbabb=abb, b=cc, d=abb, dd=d
      becomes (by Tietze2, remove redundant relation)
    b=cc, d=abb, dd=d
    ```
- Made a todo list on the PR with some next steps.

Example showing current functions, that you can replicate by checking out tomcontileslie/Semigroups on branch "tietze"!
