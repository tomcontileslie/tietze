# Week 7, Computational Mathematics Wednesday Meeting

Tom and Ben

- Warm-up: looked through documentation for fp semigroups. Mostly implemented in the main GAP distribution rather than in Semigroups. Relevant chapters of doc are
  [Chap 37](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap37.html),
  [Chap 52](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap52.html),
  [ExtRepOfObj (79.8-1)](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap79.html#X8542B32A8206118C).
- Discussed differences between Tietze for semigroup vs. monoid presentations (be careful with identity).
- Discussed how to implement the fourth Tietze transformation: removing a generator `a`. Easy if one of the relations expresses that generator in terms of the others
  (e.g. `a = cbcb`). Harder if this is not the case: can we somehow look for words in `alphabet - a` which are equal to `a`? Since the word problem is undecidable
  in general, the best we can do is try some words and see what they reduce to, and then give up after a certain amount of time. Reversing the system given
  by `ReducedConfluentRewritingSystem` (see [52.5-1](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap52.html#X7D8F804E814D894D)) could be interesting, but
  this only works if the presentation has solvable word problem.
- Discovered the following fp semigroup that has undecidable word problem; maybe useful for testing our methods against pathological examples:
```
f := FreeSemigroup("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");;
g := GeneratorsOfSemigroup(f);;
bad := "ac=ca, bc=cb, ce=eca, ad=da, bd=db, de=edb, cca=ccae";;
rels := ParseRelations(g, bad);;
s := f / rels;;
a:=s.1;;b:=s.2;;c:=s.3;;d:=s.4;;e:=s.5;;
```
- Looked at the Tietze implementation for group presentations: look at the following files in the GAP root: `src/tietze.c`, `lib/tietze.gi`, `lib/tietze.gd`.
  Also [Chap 48](https://www.gap-system.org/Manuals/doc/ref/chap48.html) of the doc. SimplifyPresentation relies on `TzGo`, which calls a number of Tietze-like
  simplification subprocesses. Some of this is group-specific but we should probably do some looking around to see which subprocesses can be simplified.
  The representation of a Tietze object is also group-specific as they set the RHS to the identity, which we won't be able to do.
- Next steps: try to replicate some of the Tietze functions for semigroups? We can work subprocess by subprocess and then think about how we want to
  fit them together.
