# Spring Break Week 1, Computational Mathematics Wednesday Meeting

Tom

- Ben did some work over the week to create a new Tietze object for semigroups. In the new file `gap/stzobj.g`, the operation
  `StzPresentation` is implemented, which takes an fp semigroup as arugment and returns an object internally represented as a
  record with components storing generator names (strings) and relations (as AssocWord ext reps).
- Idea: internal Tietze functions operate on the gens and rels of this Stz object. These will get called when running StzGo.
- Tom continued making user-accessible `TietzeTransformation1`, ..., `TietzeTransformation4` functions. Some thought should
  be put into whether or not they do any checking (e.g. if you ask to add a relation, should these functions run a check
  that the relation is indeed redundant with respect to the relations already present?). We may want to create `NC` versions
  for internal use. Since checking word equality in GAP doesn't always terminate, James suggested
- These currently don't take Ben's `StzPresentation` object as argument, but the compatibility switch should be fairly easy.
  Instead, for the time being, you can convert to stz objects compatible with `TietzeTransformation1` etc. using `FpSemigroupToStzObj`,
  and convert back using `StzObjToFpSemigroup`. Full example that currently works given below:
```
gap> f := FreeSemigroup(["a", "b"]);;
gap> AssignGeneratorVariables(f);;
#I  Assigned the global variables [ a, b ]
gap> r := ParseRelations([a, b], "aa=a, bb=b, abab=ab, baba=ba");;
gap> s := f/r;; Â # BTW this is the free band on two generators (minimal fp semigroup s.t. every word is idempotent)
gap> stz := FpSemigroupToStzObj(s);;
gap> stz.rels;
[ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ], [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ] ]
gap> TietzeTransformation1(stz, [[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 1]]);  # add a redundant relation
gap> stz.rels;
[ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ], [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ],
  [ [ 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 1, 2, 1 ] ] ]
gap> TietzeTransformation2(stz, 5);  # remove relation number 5 (that we just added)
gap> stz.rels;
[ [ [ 1, 1 ], [ 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], [ 2 ] ], [ [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ], [ [ 2, 1, 2, 1 ], [ 2, 1 ] ] ]
gap> TietzeTransformation2(stz, 1);  # try to remove relation number 1; refuses because it's not redundant
Error, Second argument <index> must point to a relation that is

```
- Wrote a helper function which takes a list of strings representing variable names, and returns a string representing a name
  for a new variable which is in the same style as the ones passed as input (e.g. if given `["a", "b", "c"]`, then `"d"` is a good
  choice; but if given `["s1", "s2", "s3"]`, then `"s4"` is probably better).
