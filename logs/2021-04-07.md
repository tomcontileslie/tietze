# Week 9, Computational Mathematics Wednesday Meeting

Tom, Ben, James
  
- Ben has done some more helpful work on creating a stz object (`IsStzPresentation`). We discussed with James the fact that since we store a stz object
  internally as a record where we intend to update lists (e.g. to add relations or generators), the StzPresentation should not be an attribute storing
  rep, since otherwise it computes these things once only. We want retrieving the lists of generators and relations to be an **operation** (different each time).
- Decided once and for all that our standardised internal word representation will be **letter rep** (so `cca` is `[3, 3, 1]`). Started changing old functions
  so that they work with letter reps (not yet finished).
- Bugfix in TietzeTransformation4 where removing e.g. the second of three generators left words containing the third generator with the number 3; if
  you remove the second generator then everything shuffles down, so that's now sorted.
- Adapted TietzeTransformation1, ..., TietzeTransformation4 so that they take a StzPresentation, rather than a raw record, as input. Done.
- Discussed and tried to get our heads around how a `SimplifyPresentation` method will spot the best simplifications. Worked through some examples.
  The obvious moves are listed in the [Week 8 reflective log](https://github.com/tomcontileslie/tietze/blob/main/logs/2021-03-17.md).
- James suggested some general principles to follow. For example, if we have an fp semigroup `s` and run `stz := StzPresentation(s)` and then apply
  Tietze transformations to `stz`, we want the final state of `stz` to look similar to what we would have gotten if we ran `StzPresentation` on the output
  semigroup. This basically means no accumulation of old data that is no longer useful, like the names of old generators.
- One exception to this is we want a way of creating a map from the start semigroup to the final product. We will do this by creating a new internal record
  component `stz!.MapToUnreducedFpSemigroup`, a list of lists initially equal to `[[1], [2], [3], ..., [n]]` where `n` is the number of generators. If we
  ever remove generator `k`, then the `k`th element of this list will be updated to equal the word we are replacing `k` with. This gives an expression
  of the original generators in terms of the output semigroup generators.
